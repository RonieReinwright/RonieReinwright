### GENERAL INFORMATION
My name is Ronie Reinwright. I would prefer to be called Ronie(***ONE N***). I do, or at least, I'm trying to do many things.

My main interests are foreign languages, drawing, creating music, cooking, coding, writing, reading, and more. I'm not great at anything in here, except for cooking, and, I guess, languages. My main focus is art. Then, after that, comes music. Although, as of right now, I'm not really working with music all that much.

I love translation and foreign languages, so you can get in touch with me for that if anything. Currently, I can only do [EN to RU], or [RU to EN] translations. Due to poor time management and having a lot of stuff going on, being busy (mostly because of poor time management lol), I doubt that I'll be an "always-available" type of guy, though. Sorry!

## - üíª Programming languages I know:
- Python. [Very beginner-like and amateur]
- GDScript. [Quite amateur]
- HTML/CSS [I can hack around with documentation]

## - üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...
- Finishing my school-graduation-grade card deck number game project that I hacked up in a random IT class and never finished it for 2 or something years...
- A small personal tracker thing for Lobotomy Corporation
- Rewriting a game in Godot Engine because it contracted the "opening a lightweight scene with two nodes for 10 billion years" disease

## - üå± I‚Äôm currently learning...
- Drawing and getting my art quality to a semi-adequate level (subjective). *`Everything done is a preparation.`*
- A little bit of Python with its addendums here and there.
- Game development in Godot Engine.

## - üì´ How to reach me:
- Discord. `roniereinwright` or `Ronie Reinwright#0901`

Yes, I am an average Helltaker enjoyer. How did you know?
